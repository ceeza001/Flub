              <p className="text-[14px] ">This is the start of Flubs Journey in crypto. Flub was created and thought of by me CrypticZ or CrypticZach. Flub is an original Meme character hoping to shine in the spot light. Flub will have a limited number of NFT’s that will be available to mint soon. More details are to come regarding the NFT’s but for now I can tell you that a certain number of NFT’s will be featured in the Flub animated series. The NFT’s will be available to mint with SOL or $Flub. Now if you mint your NFT with $Flub those tokens will get sent over to the incinerator and burnt. The NFT’s that are minted with SOL will be used to help further push the project like Marketing, buyback & burns, and even giveaways.
My vision is to have FLUB seen everywhere and make it into the top meme coins. Flub wants to build a community of like-minded people who want nothing but the positive things in life and to succeed.</p>
